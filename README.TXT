PROJECT TITLE: Bob's Adventure
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Final Game for Ap Computer Science
VERSION or DATE: Current:  Ver.1
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Compile newFrame, and run it.
AUTHORS: James Reinier, James Reinier from the past
USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
Use Arrow keys to move the rectangle around. 
The buttons have no use, they are just there for testing the panel. 
The frame walls will not let you go through. They are barriers, and a proof that I can actually make them.


Log 001: After a huge amount of mental block, and finally getting my notes back from the MacBook (Thank you, Mr. Seaver and Mr. Knoll), I was able to program basic movement, and set up the classes to add more objects in the future. Tommorrows goal is to make the actual room, make objects to be in the room, and set up some sort of collision detection. And, hopefully, a way to display certain phrases of text based on what you run into.
